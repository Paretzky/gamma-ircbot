## node-ircbot

Aims to be a easy to use, reliable, and close to the metal IRC bot.  For now, targeting the freenode.net irc network.

### Notes about running paretzky-node-irc
* You'll have to remove irchelper.pipe after each run of myirc2.js.  It is the main communication channel between the plugins and various parts of this program and must not exist when first running myirc2.js.
* Currently this is only tested on fc1{6,7}.x64
* plugins/qalc.js depends on Qalculate and "qalc" being in your path

### Features

* Command line access to all functionality (plugins/cmd.js)
  * Client commands to interact with irc

### Plugin Management 

Plugins are all run in their own processes.  Currently to stop a plugin you'll want to send a SIGINT (ctrl+c) or SIGKILL kill -9.  

By design everything will just unhook from the main process and reconnect once you restart.  Make sure you're currently in /PATH/TO/paretzky-node-ircbot/ as your present working directory.  Run node plugins/name.js for each plugin to restart.

To see what plugins are running, you have two options.  Check the main myirc2.js log to see what was started.  Or just run ps and grep for the children of node myirc2.js.
